## Configuration
Firstly you need to copy the file `.env.example.js` to `.env.js` and edit it with your environment configuration.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
